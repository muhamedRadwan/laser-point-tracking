# **Laser-point-interaction

## ** Desktop APP build using **java , openCV**
This App Tracking Laser Point ant interact with it USing your Laptop Camera 

## Features 
1. Convert Image TO Gray Scale 
2. Mark High Brightness points
3. Play Realy time Tracking For Laser Or any High Brightness device (Tourch)
## uses:
1. you can use it to get **Brightness point** in image. 
2. convert images to **grayscale** "Black & White".
3. interact with PC using Laser .
   * you should have **PC Camira** to can use option **3**

## Build using >
1. Java.
2. openCV.
3. DWT algorithm.


## You should install **openCV-v-3.1.0** it's very important.
 
##there exist Classes >

* **MainFrame**  : have **GUI-Main-Frame** Class.
* **DWT** : have implementation code of **DWT algo** Class.
* **CoreCode** : have some Core function that make hard processing. 

## requirement to start

## How use it >

* Run **MainFrame** Class to start **GUI** 

1. **Brightness point**
  * Choice **image** from your pc.
  * Click on **points** to detect **Brightness points**.
2. Conver image to **GrayScale**
  * Choice **image** from your pc. 
  * Click on **GrayScale**.
3. intract with **PC** using **Laser**
  * Click on **Vedio**.
  * Direct **Laser Beam** to **PC Screen**.
  * Move your hand .
  * Direct the **Beam** to video edges to intract.
    * **UP-edge** : make video  **GrayScale** automatically.
    * **Down-edge** : make video **RGB** automatically.
    * **Right-edge** : take **ScreanShot**.
    * **Left-edge** : to **Exit** form program
